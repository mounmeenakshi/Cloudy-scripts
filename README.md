The cloudy scripts are used to evaluate a radio loud AGN spectrum matched to Shang et. al (2011). The shang_incident_sed.in is run where the incident SED of the QSO 
is propagated through the typical BLR region. The generated transmitted spectrum file is used to run the final SED file shang_final_sed.pdf.
The incident SED has a total luminosity of 10^45 erg/s, and the components can be easily scaled for higher luminosities. 
We assume a covering factor of 30% for the BLR, and thus the final SED constitues 70% of the incident and 30% of the transmitted value.
